# Ping Pong Pairing

## Description

Begin work on a new, large Rails app, but do so using ping-pong pair programming.  Getting in time with your partner, writing good tests, and #shipit is more important than finishing particular features.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand the benefits of Rails testing
* Be able to determine and articulate features in a minimum viable product
* Be able to write unit tests during TDD
* Be able to write controller tests during TDD
* Be able to write integration tests during TDD
* Have experience working with ping-pong pair programming
* Have some experience struggling with fragile tests

## Deliverables

* **A github organization.** Create an organization in github to represent your team for this project.  Give all team members full rights.
* **A Repository.** Create a new repository under your github organization's account.
* **A README.** Your README needs to be a bit different for this project.  Feel free to include any of the standard content you'd usually put in a README, but you MUST include a description of each minimum viable product that you work towards along the way.
* **A Working Heroku Link.** Since #shipit is such a big deal on this assignment, having a working app on Heroku is critical.

## Requirements

For this project, you will be building a new rails application from scratch in pairs, and you will get as far as you can in a fixed amount of time.  Your instructor will provide a link to the project on which you'll start.

As you work, you will be responsible for doing two things BEFORE writing code:

* Write a test.  Then write code, then write another test, etc.  Basically, use Test Driven Development.  More specifically, use Ping-Pong Pairing.  One person (A) will be responsible for writing a test, then the other person (B) will be responsible for writing code to make the test pass.  Then A writes another test and B makes it pass.  Switch roles every few hours.
* Decide on minimum viable products.  Before writing any code, you should explicitly decide what your first #shipit goal will be, then write a description in the README.  Once you write code that meets your goal, #shipit to Heroku, stop coding, and write up your next goal in your README and start over.

Since this assignment is time-based rather than feature-based, there is no difference between Normal, Hard, and Nightmare modes.
